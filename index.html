                 <p>JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with 
                  first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in 
                  many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language 
                  that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</p>

                  <p>JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web 
                  pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful

                  architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally 
                  created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other web content types including more 
                  traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems 
                  (LMS) and online stores. One of the most popular content management system solutions in use, WordPress 
                  is used by 42.8% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021. </p>

                 <p>React (ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces 
                  based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual 
                  developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, 
                  mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned 
                  with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually 
                  requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality</p>
                  <p>Now I have practice frontend with reactJS or react app. I have done my last project with react app which

                 <p>Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted 
                  or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.Sass 
                  consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar 
                  to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. 
                  The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to 
                  denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files 
                  are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.  </p>
